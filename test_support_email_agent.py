Subject: Account Login Issues

Dear Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to report an issue I'm experiencing with my account login. 

Every time I try to log in with my credentials, I receive an error message stating "Invalid credentials" even though I'm confident that my username and password are correct. I've tried resetting my password twice, but the problem persists.

Could you please help me resolve this issue? I need to access my account urgently for an important project.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,

Subject: API Integration Problems

Hello Support,

I'm a developer trying to integrate with your API, but I keep getting 401 errors even with the correct API key. I've checked the documentation multiple times.

Here are the details:
- API Key: [REDACTED]

Can someone from the technical team help me with this?
